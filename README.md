## :page_facing_up: Explanation

This project is a visual representation of an Instagram profile page, but with a unique twist: it features characters from the popular manga and anime series, One Piece. The page includes a profile picture, a bio section, a list of posts with images and captions, and a sidebar with additional information. Each post is represented by a character from the One Piece universe, with their image and a caption that relates to their personality or story. The overall design is inspired by the theme of pirates and the world of One Piece, with a dark color scheme and bold typography. The project was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it serves as a fun and creative way to showcase skills in web development while also appealing to fans of the One Piece franchise.
